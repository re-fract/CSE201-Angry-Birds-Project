When you first run the program, you will see four clickable buttons: "Play", "Exit" and two star buttons. The two star buttons are dummy buttons that lead to 'Level Failed' and 'Level Completed' screens respectively. Exit quits the game and Play takes you to the Choose Level screen where you choose a level. For now, only one level has been implement as a static gui. You can pause the game which draws the pause menu over your current screen from which you can resume or exit the gane.

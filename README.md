## 🎯 How to Play

### 🎮 Basic Controls
- **🖱️ Mouse/Touch**: Aim and shoot birds
- **⏸️ Pause**: Access pause menu during gameplay
- **🏠 Home**: Return to main menu
- **🔄 Retry**: Restart current level

### 🏆 Objective
Destroy all pigs using the limited number of birds available. Each level requires different strategies:

1. **🎯 Aim Carefully** - Consider trajectory and physics
2. **💥 Use Bird Abilities** - Each bird type has unique properties
3. **🧠 Strategic Thinking** - Sometimes indirect shots work better
4. **⚡ Chain Reactions** - Use falling blocks to your advantage

### 🌟 Scoring
- **Direct Hits** on pigs award points
- **Block Destruction** provides bonus points
- **Remaining Birds** multiply your final score
